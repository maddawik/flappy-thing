## Main goals

- [x] Create a game world with a floor.
- [x] Add an object that represents the main character. Apply a constant force to
      the character so it falls to the floor.
- [x] Add obstacles on the left of the game area. The obstacles should slide across
      the screen toward the right. The obstacles will appear in pairs, with a
      vertical gap between them.
- [x] Detect when the character collides with the floor or obstacles, and reset
      the game when a collision occurs.
- [x] Accumulate one point for each obstacle that the player passes. Display
      the score.

## Stretch goals

- [x] Add some sounds that will play each time the player gains a point, and
      when the player loses.
- [x] Add a basic game-over screen to display the playerâ€™s score.
- [x] Track the high-score between play sessions and display the high score
      alongside the current score.
- [x] Add some background art! Try layering the background and scrolling at a
      different rate to the foreground obstacles. This is called Parallax scrolling.

## Full-split goals

- [ ] Add a settings menu with options to mix sound levels, view credits, and
      change controls
- [ ] Make it so that the difficulty increases over time. Moving faster, pipes are
      closer horizontally/vertically, other obstacles?
- [ ] Character customization feature! Change Kenny's color? Maybe more? ðŸ¤”
